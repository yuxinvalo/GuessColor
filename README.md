#<center>Guess Color</center>
This is a mini game coded in java, you have 5 times to guess the colors in 4 columns.<br/>
Well it's really boring, but that's is the homework... <br/>
And we learn the MVC model where Model is the enum Color, Visual is defined in UIGame.java and Controller is defined in GuessColor.java.<br/>
